# challenge4

### Overview
This program uses a Binary Search Tree class and a Linked List class to compare the efficency of
the two data structures. It tests the insert speed as well as the searching speed for both, using 
the same data. The code uses chrono to time operations.

### tests
* tests inserts with 12 random numbers 1-1000
* tests inserts with 24 random numbers 1-1000
* tests inserts with 200 random numbers 1-1000
* tests inserts with 1000 random numbers 1-1000
* tests the search speed for 10 random numbers with each data set
* test insert of 1-1000 in order
* test insert of 1000-1 in order
